Differences between driver versions.
================================================================

- TDI driver works on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.

- WFP driver works on Windows 7 and higher. It is required on Windows 8 and higher to filter Metro applications and other processes in AppContainers, because Microsoft has disabled TDI interface for this kind of applications.
